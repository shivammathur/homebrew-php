### Debug versions

For each PHP version, there is an extra formula with debug symbols enabled. This version can be used when building
or debugging PHP extensions and are not recommended for production usage.

## OS Support

|Operating System|Architecture|
|--- |--- |
|Linux|`x86_64`|
|macOS Monterey|`x86_64`, `arm64`|
|macOS Ventura|`x86_64`, `arm64`|
|macOS Sonoma|`x86_64`, `arm64`|

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- On macOS, install Xcode Command Line Utilities:

```zsh
xcode-select --install
```

- On Linux, install cURL and Git:

```bash
# Using APT
sudo apt-get install -y curl git

# Using Yum
sudo yum install -y curl git
```

- Install Homebrew:

```zsh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

- If previously installed, update homebrew and the formulae:

```zsh
brew update
```

- If you have packages from old `homebrew/php` tap, refer to [this guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php/wiki/Cleanup) for removing them.

### Add this tap

Fetch the formulae in this tap:

```zsh
brew tap shivammathur/php
```

### Install PHP

> See [PHP Support](#php-support) for available formulae.

- For example, to install `PHP 8.1`:

```zsh 
brew install shivammathur/php/php@8.1
```

- After installing you have to link it:

```zsh
brew link --overwrite --force shivammathur/php/php@8.1
```

- Restart the terminal and test your PHP version:

```zsh
php -v
```

### Upgrade your PHP version

You can upgrade your PHP version to the latest patch release.

For example, to upgrade `PHP 8.1`:

```zsh
brew upgrade shivammathur/php/php@8.1
```

### Switch between PHP versions

- If you have multiple PHP versions installed, you can switch between them easily.

For example, to switch to `PHP 8.1`:

```zsh
brew link --overwrite --force shivammathur/php/php@8.1
```

- If you get a warning like below, then do as recommended:

```zsh
Warning: Already linked: <Cellar Path>
To relink:
  brew unlink <formula> && brew link <formula>
```

```zsh
brew unlink php@8.1
brew link --overwrite --force shivammathur/php/php@8.1
```

### Restart your webserver

If you are using `Apache` or `Nginx` with `php-fpm`, restart your webserver after any change in your PHP.

- For Apache (`httpd`):

```zsh
brew services restart httpd
```
- For Nginx:

```zsh
brew services restart nginx
```

## Debugging

- Make sure you ran `brew update` before installing PHP.

- Run `brew doctor` and fix the warnings it reports.

- Make sure homebrew has correct permissions.

```zsh
sudo chown -R "$(id -un)":"$(id -gn)" $(brew --prefix)
```

- If PHP is not working after a macOS update. Reinstall PHP along with its dependencies.

For example to reinstall `PHP 8.1` and its dependencies:

```zsh
brew reinstall $(brew deps shivammathur/php/php@8.1) shivammathur/php/php@8.1
```

- Check if your issue is a Homebrew's [common issue](https://docs.brew.sh/Common-Issues).
